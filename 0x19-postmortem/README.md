**# Postmortem: Moroccan Web Mapping Application Outage**

## Issue Summary

**Duration:** June 15, 2023, 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM (GMT+1)

**Impact:** A critical Docker container hosting the Moroccan web mapping application unexpectedly terminated, causing a 4-hour outage for users (approximately 40% impacted). The application, similar to Waze, provides navigation and location services across Morocco.

**Root Cause:** Resource constraints led to the Docker container termination, resulting in service unavailability.

## Timeline

* **8:00 AM:** Monitoring dashboard detects anomaly (reduced server response times, increased error rates).
* **8:05 AM:** Initial investigation focuses on network and database, but no issues found.
* **8:30 AM:** Discovery of the stopped Docker container hosting the web application.
* **9:00 AM:** Escalation to the DevOps team for resolution.
* **10:00 PM:** Identification of resource constraints as the root cause.
* **11:00 PM:** Implementation of mitigation steps (restarting container, allocating additional resources).
* **12:00 PM:** Monitoring confirms service restoration, incident declared resolved.

## Resolution and Corrective Actions

* **Immediate:** Restarted the Docker container and allocated more resources for stable operation.
* **Future:**
    * Implement automatic resource scaling based on workload demands.
    * Enhance monitoring and alerting for real-time container health and performance insights.
    * Conduct a thorough review of Docker container configurations to optimize resource allocation.
    * Develop and implement a comprehensive container orchestration strategy for improved fault tolerance and high availability.
    * Establish regular performance testing and capacity planning to proactively identify potential bottlenecks.

## Lessons Learned

* Proactive resource management and effective monitoring are crucial for application reliability and availability.
* Implementing the planned corrective actions aims to minimize the impact of similar incidents in the future and ensure a seamless user experience.
